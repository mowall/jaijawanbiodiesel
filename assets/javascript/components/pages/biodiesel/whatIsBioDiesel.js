                		<br />
                		<p>
                		Biodiesel refers to a non-petroleum-based diesel fuel consisting of short chain alkyl (methyl or ethyl) esters, made by Transesterfication of vegetable oil or animal fat (tallow), which can be used (alone, or blended with conventional petrodiesel) in unmodified diesel-engine vehicles. Biodiesel is distinguished from the straight vegetable oil (SVO) (sometimes referred to as "waste vegetable oil", "WVO", "used vegetable oil", "UVO", "pure plant oil", "PPO") used (alone, or blended) as fuels in some converted diesel vehicles. "Biodiesel" is standardized as mono-alkyl ester.

                		<p>
                		Biodiesel is a biofuel produced from various feedstock’s including vegetable oils (such as oilseed, rapeseed and soya bean), animal fats or algae. Biodiesel can be blended with diesel for use in diesel engine vehicles. Biofuel – The term biofuel applies to any solid, liquid, or gaseous fuel produced from organic (once-living) matter. The word biofuel covers a wide range of products, some of which are commercially available today, and some of which are still in research and development. Biodiesel is a fuel made from plant oils that can be used in a conventional diesel engine.

                		<p>
  						Biodiesel is an environmentally safe, low polluting fuel for most diesel internal combustion and turbine engines. Can be mixed with petroleum diesel fuel and stored anywhere petroleum is. It is made from fresh or waste vegetable oils (triglycerides) that are a renewable energy source.

                		<p>
                		Bio-diesel is an eco-friendly, alternative diesel fuel prepared from domestic renewable resources that is vegetables oils (edible & non-edible oil) and animal fats. These natural oils & fats are made up mainly of tryglycerides. These tryglycerides when reacted chemically with lower alcohols in presence of catalyst result in fatty acid esters. These esters show striking similarity to petroleum derived diesel and are called “Bio-diesel”.

                		<p>
                		Bio-diesel is the most valuable form of renewable energy that can be used directly in any existing, unmodified diesel engine.

                			<li>
                			Energy Independence: Considering that oil priced at $ 60 per barrel has had a disproportionate impact on the poorest countries, 38 of which are net importers and 25 of Which import all of their oil; the question of trying to achieve greater energy independence one day through the development of bio-fuels has become one of ‘when’ rather than ‘if,’ and, now on a near daily basis, a bio-fuels programme is being launched somewhere in the developing world.
                			</li>
                			<li>
                			Smaller Trade Deficit: Rather than importing other countries’ ancient natural resources, we could be using our own living resources to power our development and enhance our economies. Instead of looking to the Mid-east for oil, the world could look to the tropics for bio-fuels. producing more bio-fuels will save foreign exchange and reduce energy expenditures and allow developing countries to put more of their resources into health, education and other services for their neediest citizens.
                			</li>
                			<li>
                			Economic Growth: Bio-fuels create new markets for agricultural products and stimulate rural development because bio-fuels are generated from crops; they hold enormous potential for farmers. In the near future—especially for the two-thirds of the people in the developing world who derive their incomes from agriculture.Today, many of these farmers are too small to compete in the global market, especially with the playing field tilted against them through trade distorting agricultural subsidies. They are mostly subsistence farmers who, in a good year, produce enough to feed their families, and in a bad year, grow even poorer or starve. But bio-fuels have enormous potential to change this situation for the better.At the community level, farmers that produce dedicated energy crops can grow their incomes and grow their own supply of affordable and reliable energy.At the national level, producing more bio-fuels will generate new industries, new technologies, new jobs and new markets.
                			</li>
                			<li>
                			Cleaner Air: Bio-fuels burn more cleanly than gasoline and diesel. Using biofuels means producing fewer emissions of carbon monoxide, particulates, and toxic chemicals that cause smog, aggravate respiratory and heart disease, and contribute to thousands of premature deaths each year.
                			</li>
                			<li>
                			Less Global Warming: Bio-fuels contain carbon that was taken out of the atmosphere by plants and trees as they grew. The Fossil fuels are adding huge amounts of stored carbon dioxide (CO2) to the atmosphere, where it traps the Earth's heat like a heavy blanket and causes the world to warm. Studies show that bio-diesel reduces CO2 emissions to a considerable extent and in some cases all most nearly to zero.

                		<p>
                		Biodiesel fuel burns up to 75% cleaner than diesel fuel made from fossil fuels. Bio diesel substantially reduces unburned hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide and particulate matter in exhaust fumes. Sulphur dioxide emissions are 100% eliminated (bio diesel contains no sulphur). This alternative fuel is plant-based and adds absolutely no CO2 to the atmosphere.	
                		</p>
                		<br />
                		<p>
                		Biofuel exhaust is not offensive and doesn't cause eye irritation. Vehicles do not spew out vile black fumes/particulates. In fact if you make your fuel from used cooking oil it may even smell of chips. Biodiesel is environmentally friendly: it is renewable, "more biodegradable than sugar and less toxic than table salt" (US National Biodiesel Board).
                		</p>
                		<br />
                		<p>
                		Biodiesel was the first renewable fuel to successfully complete the EPA-required Health Effects esting under the Clean Air Act. Mutagenicity studies show that biofuel dramatically reduces potential risks of cancer and birth defects.

                		<br />
                		<p>
                		Biodiesel helps preserve natural resources. For every unit of energy needed to produce biodiesel, 3.24 units of energy are gained - nearly four times more than diesel.

                		BioDiesel is environmental friendly and ideal for heavily polluted cities. Bio Diesel is as biodegradable as salt Bio Diesel produces 80% less carbon dioxide and 100% less sulfur dioxide emissions. It provides a 90% reduction in cancer risks. Bio Diesel can be used alone or mixed in any ratio with mineral oil diesel fuel. The preferred ratio if mixture ranges between 5 and 20% (B5 - B20).Bio Diesel extends the live of diesel engines. Bio Diesel is cheaper then mineral oil diesel. Bio Diesel is conserving natural resources.
