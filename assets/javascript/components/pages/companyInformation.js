                    He thought of developing an alternative source of energy that can reduce pollution levels in our country, organic in nature. Soon his thought were materialised into action when the idea/concept of trading Biodiesel crystallized. The feedstock used was organic in character which produced Biodiesel as per the ASTM, EN and BIS Standards. This marked the beginning of our organization.  India  imports  more  than  70%  of  crude  oil,  which  is  one  of  the  largest  petroleum  consuming  countries.  India  can  save  upto  Rs.70,000 crore by using greenfuel/ biodiesel.
