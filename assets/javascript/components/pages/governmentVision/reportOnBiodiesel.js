               <p>
               The efficacy of biodiesel as an automotive fuel is well recognized. Several
               countries including U.S.A. are substituting the conventional mineral diesel
               by biodiesel to address the issues of air quality and energy security. The 
               availability of wastelands, presence of a variety of non-edible oil seeds and
               plants, prospects of development of rural economy, biodegradability and emission
               benefits are some of the positive attributes which qualify biodiesel especially 
               its blends to be a prominent contender for substituting petrodiesel in India. 
               Moreover, the technological requirements for process and production of biodiesel 
               being comparatively less cumbersome and its ability to fuel an existing diesel 
               vehicle with no or minor modifications also make it a promising alternate fuel.

               In recent years several initiatives are being taken in India to bring this fuel 
               from the fields to the wheels. The Planning Commission, Government of India has 
               constituted a Committee for “ Development of biofuels” with experts from 
               organizations like CPCB, IIP, MNES, IOC (R&D), etc.

               emissions, prospects of the fuel in India and other technological aspects.Thanks
