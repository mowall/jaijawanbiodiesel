                    <b>JAI JAWAN BIODIESEL PVT. LTD </b> is a biodiesel Exporters, Importers & Wholeseller  company.     Jai Jawan BioDiesel  was conceived by a group of Technologists with a comprehensive professional experience with multinational companies under the able Leadership of Mr. Rishabh Gupta(Lucky) who is the M.D & Chief of Technology of the company. Mr. Rishabh Gupta(Lucky)  proposed a journey for the present society at large from the present polluted and harmful environment back to the green and pure environment as it was ages before.

                    He thought of developing an alternative source of energy that can reduce pollution levels in our country, organic in nature. Soon his thought were materialised into action when the idea/concept of trading Biodiesel crystallized. The feedstock used was organic in character which produced Biodiesel as per the ASTM, EN and BIS Standards. This marked the beginning of our organization.  India  imports  more  than  70%  of  crude  oil,  which  is  one  of  the  largest  petroleum  consuming  countries.  India  can  save  upto  Rs.70,000 crore by using greenfuel/ biodiesel.

                                Bio-fuels create new markets for agricultural products and stimulate rural development because bio-fuels are generated from crops; they hold enormous potential for farmers. In the near future—especially for the two-thirds of the people in the developing world who derive their incomes from agriculture.

                                Today, many of these farmers are too small to compete in the global market, especially with the playing field tilted against them through trade distorting agricultural subsidies. They are mostly subsistence farmers who, in a good year, produce enough to feed their families, and in a bad year, grow even poorer or starve. But bio-fuels have enormous potential to change this situation for the better.

                                At the community level, farmers that produce dedicated energy crops can grow their incomes and grow their own supply of affordable and reliable energy.At the national level, producing more bio-fuels will generate new industries, new Technocrats, new jobs and new markets.

                           Bio-fuels burn more cleanly than gasoline and diesel. Using biofuels means producing fewer emissions of carbon monoxide, particulates, and toxic chemicals that cause smog, aggravate respiratory and heart disease, and contribute to thousands of premature deaths each year.

                            Bio-fuels contain carbon that was taken out of the atmosphere by plants and trees as they grew. The Fossil fuels are adding huge amounts of stored carbon dioxide (CO2) to the atmosphere, where it traps the Earth's heat like a heavy blanket and causes the world to warm. Studies show that bio-diesel reduces CO2 emissions to a considerable extent and in some cases all most nearly to zero.

                    <h2 className='defaultHeader'>What is BioDiesel</h2>
                    <p>
                    Biodiesel refers to a non-petroleum-based diesel fuel consisting of short chain alkyl (methyl or ethyl) esters, made by Transesterfication of vegetable oil or animal fat (tallow), which can be used (alone, or blended with conventional petrodiesel) in unmodified diesel-engine vehicles. Biodiesel is distinguished from the straight vegetable oil (SVO) (sometimes referred to as "waste vegetable oil", "WVO", "used vegetable oil", "UVO", "pure plant oil", "PPO") used (alone, or blended) as fuels in some converted diesel vehicles. "Biodiesel" is standardized as mono-alkyl ester.

                    <p>
                        Biodiesel is a biofuel produced from various feedstock’s including vegetable oils (such as oilseed, rapeseed and soya bean), animal fats or algae. Biodiesel can be blended with diesel for use in diesel engine vehicles. Biofuel – The term biofuel applies to any solid, liquid, or gaseous fuel produced from organic (once-living) matter. The word biofuel covers a wide range of products, some of which are commercially available today, and some of which are still in research and development. Biodiesel is a fuel made from plant oils that can be used in a conventional diesel engine.

                    <h2 className='defaultHeader'>Current Research</h2>
                    <p>
                        There is ongoing research into finding more suitable crops and improving oil yield. Other sources are possible including human fecal matter, with Ghana building its first "fecal sludge-fed biodiesel plant.".Using the current yields, vast amounts of land and fresh water would be needed to produce enough oil to completely replace fossil fuel usage. It would require twice the land area of the US to be devoted to soybean production, or two-thirds to be devoted to rapeseed production, to meet current US heating and transportation needs.
