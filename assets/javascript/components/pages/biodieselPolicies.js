               					India is one of the fastest growing economies in the world. The
								Development Objectives focus on economic growth, equity and human well
								being. Energy is a critical input for socio-economic development. The energy
								strategy of a country aims at efficiency and security and to provide access which
								being environment friendly and achievement of an optimum mix of primary
								resources for energy generation. Fossil fuels will continue to play a dominant
								role in the energy scenario in our country in the next few decades. However,
								conventional or fossil fuel resources are limited, non-renewable, polluting and,
								therefore, need to be used prudently. On the other hand, renewable energy
								resources are indigenous, non-polluting and virtually inexhaustible.
								India is endowed with abundant renewable energy resources. Therefore, their use should
								be encouraged in every possible way.

               					The crude oil price
								has been fluctuating in the world market and has
								increased significantly in the recent past, reaching a level of more than $ 140 per
								barrel.
								Such unforeseen escalation of crude oil prices is severely straining
								various economies the world over, particularly those
								of the developing
								countries. Petro-based oil meets about 95% of the requirement for transportation
								fuels, and the demand
								has been steadily rising.
								Provisional estimates have
								indicated crude oil consumption in 2007-08 at about 156 million tonnes. The
								domestic crude oil is able to meet only about 23% of the demand, while the rest is
								met from imported crude.

               					India’s energy security would remain vulnerable until alternative fuels to
								substitute/supplement petro-based fuels are
								developed based on indigenously
								produced renewable feedstocks. In biofuels, the country has a ray of hope in
								providing energy security. Biofuels are
								utilization
								would address
								environment friendly fuels and their
								global concerns about containment of carbon
								emissions. The transportation sector has been identified as a major polluting
								sector.
								Use of biofuels have, therefore, become compelling in view of the
								tightening automotive vehicle emission standards to curb air pollution.

               					Biofuels are derived from renewable bio-mass resources and, therefore,
								provide a strategic advantage to promote sustainable development and to
								supplement conventional energy sources in meeting the rapidly increasing
								requirements for transportation fuels associated with high economic growth, as
								well as in meeting the energy needs of India’s vast rural population. Biofuels can
								increasingly satisfy these energy needs in an environmentally benign and cost-
								effective manner while reducing dependence on import of fossil fuels and
								thereby providing a higher degree of National Energy Security.

               					The growth of biofuels around the globe is spurred largely by energy
								security and environmental concerns and a wide range of market mechanisms,
								incentives and subsidies have been put in place to facilitate their growth.
								Developing countries, apart from these considerations, also view biofuels as a
								potential means to stimulate rural development and
								create employment
								opportunities. The Indian approach to biofuels, in particular, is somewhat
								different to the current international approaches which could lead to conflict with
								food security. It is based solely on non-food feedstocks to be raised on degraded or wastelands that are not suited to agriculture, thus avoiding a possible conflict
								of fuel vs. food security.

               					In the context of the International perspectives and National imperatives,
								it is the endeavour of this Policy to facilitate and bring about optimal
								development and utilization of indigenous biomass feedstocks for production of
								biofuels. The Policy also envisages development of the next generation of more
								efficient biofuel conversion technologies based on new feedstocks. The Policy
								sets out the Vision, medium term Goals, strategy and
								approach to biofuel
								development, and proposes a framework of technological, financial and
								institutional interventions and enabling mechanisms.
