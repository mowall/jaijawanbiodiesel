						        The crude oil price

						        The growth of biofuels around the globe is spurred largely by energy
								security and environmental concerns and a wide range of market mechanisms,
								incentives and subsidies have been put in place to facilitate their growth.
								Developing countries, apart from these considerations, also view biofuels as a
								potential means to stimulate rural development and
								create employment
								opportunities. The Indian approach to biofuels, in particular, is somewhat
								different to the current international approaches which could lead to conflict with
								food security. It is based solely on non-food feedstocks to be raised on degraded or wastelands that are not suited to agriculture, thus avoiding a possible conflict
								of fuel vs. food security.
